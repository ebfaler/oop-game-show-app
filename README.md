# Object Oriented Programming Game Show App #

Unit 4 Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree

I have created a browser based word guessing game using Javascrips and OOP (Object Oriented Programming). A phrase is displayed at random and the user has 5 attempts to guess the correct letters in the phrase. Depending on the result, a 'win' or 'lose' overlay is displayed. And the user is able to reset the game and start over.


For Exceeds Requirements:

* I have allowed players to use their physical computer keyboard to enter guesses by using the keydown event listener.

* I have personalised the game by:
  * Adding animations to the game title and to the letters when the showMatchedLetter()method is called.
  * Making the start button increase in size on hover.
  * Changing the background color of the start overlay and of the main game overlay.
